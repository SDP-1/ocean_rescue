# 🌊 Ocean Rescue - Ocean and Beach Cleanup App

**Ocean Rescue** is a mobile application to empower communities, NGOs, and local authorities to address the critical issue of marine pollution through organized beach and ocean cleanups. By connecting people through event management, tracking environmental impact, and incentivizing participation with gamification, the app supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: "Life Below Water."

## 🌍 Project Overview

### 1. Introduction
Ocean Rescue is a unique mobile app created to assist in attaining the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. The issues posed by accumulating debris on coastlines and in the marine environment have led to severe injuries for marine species, even pushing some toward extinction. Ocean Rescue is an Innovex application dedicated to enabling communities and individuals to take meaningful action against marine pollution and environmental degradation. 

This initiative establishes a unified network of volunteers, local authorities, non-profit organizations, and community members focused on marine conservation. Ocean Rescue offers a wide range of features to help users become involved in local clean-ups, track their ecological footprint, and connect with like-minded individuals. By generating unique QR codes, users can verify their participation in clean-up events, manage and share events on an interactive social feed, and receive instant notifications about nearby events.

To encourage sustained participation, Ocean Rescue incorporates gamification elements, allowing users to earn experience points, climb leadership boards, and earn badges as a recognition of their efforts. The app also promotes knowledge sharing by highlighting effective clean-up initiatives and providing a platform for users to exchange experiences and insights.

Beyond its user-focused features, Ocean Rescue is distinguished by its integration of data collection and reporting functions. This enables individuals to track their personal contributions while feeding into global databases on marine debris, thus contributing to broader research and policy-making efforts for ocean preservation. Through social engagement, technology, and data-driven insights, Ocean Rescue aspires to be a powerful catalyst for change, inspiring and mobilizing active global citizenship toward the health and sustainability of our marine ecosystems.
